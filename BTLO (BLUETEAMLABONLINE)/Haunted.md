# Haunted

**Scenario**\
Haunted Company Inc., a long-established Credit Reporting Agency, has been successfully operating in major financial hubs such as New York, London, and Tokyo. As a privately owned entity without external investors, the company has maintained consistent client satisfaction and steady earnings reports. With plans for expansion, the management has decided to take the company public, and the Initial Public Offering (IPO) is scheduled to occur within the next few days.

However, a crisis emerged just as the IPO date approaches. One of the company's websites has been defaced, raising alarms. Shortly after, it is discovered that the company's Tokyo server has come under attack. Concerned about the timing and the potential damage to the companyâ€™s reputation, the management is determined to identify the threat actor behind this attack and understand the breach mechanism to create detection before the IPO.

As a Threat Intelligence Analyst, you are tasked with collaborating with other analysts to uncover the identity of the adversary and assess the situation.

Available External and Internal Threat Intelligence:

New York(External: Business Commonality): Report on the 2017 GenX Breach, a major cyber attack on a leading Credit Reporting Agency. London(Internal Intelligence: Adversary Analysis): Analysis report for Haunted Company Inc., including Asset-Threat Mapping and adversary analysis featuring FIN7, APT27, Twisted Spider, and TG-3390, all of which are known to target the finance sector. Tokyo(Cyber Activity Attribution): Malware analysis from the compromised server, providing critical insights into the tools used during the attack.



### Overview

This investigation focuses on a cyberattack against Haunted Company Inc., a Credit Reporting Agency preparing for an Initial Public Offering (IPO). The company's website was defaced and their Tokyo server was compromised, creating significant reputational risk just days before going public.

### Lab Setup

Upon deploying the investigation machine, we find an "Investigation" folder on the desktop containing:

* `README.txt` - Scenario description and HTML link
* `DecodeME.txt` - Base64 encoded strings

The investigation requires:

1. Decoding the base64 content from `DecodeME.txt`
2. Submitting the decoded HTML to complete the threat intelligence interface
3. Analyzing three threat intelligence reports from New York, London, and Tokyo

### Investigation Questions and Solutions
